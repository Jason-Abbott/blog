Some days feel like doom and I don’t like it.

For the last couple of months I’ve been working on my own, here at home, to finish building a software application. I’ll say more about that later.

I expected that quitting my upper middle class job, no longer having any co-workers and living on credit, might sometimes feel bad. And it has. But not for the rational reasons I expected.

A tight personal budget and long hours aren’t always fun, sure, but it’s what didn’t change that feels the worst: days stuck in unplanned, trial-and-error programming or hitting a dead end and realizing days of effort were wasted.

Those were always frustrating experiences but also typical. It’s how building complex things *goes*. But now those things can feel world-ending in a way that is out of proportion and unfamiliar.

I have an idea—at least a hope—that writing can put them in a more sensible, less alarming light.

So far it’s a failure. The couple hours it took to set up this blogging thing are feeling like more of the not-productive-time-that-will-cause-disaster.

Maybe I’ll keep at it, though.
